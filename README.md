# This is a example project to take a word list in a text file, load into JavaScript array and then have a function that will return a random word out of the array.

Open index.html in a browser and it demo the javascript function pulling a random word from the dictionary.


To Rebuild a new dictionary.py, use the included python script to re do the JavaScript array.

1. Get a word list, I am including one from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words aka words_alpha.txt

2. Run the `python writejsArrayFromDict.py > dictionary.js`  to create an new dictionary.js file
