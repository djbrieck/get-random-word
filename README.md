# This is a simple example project to take a word list in a text file, load into javascript array and then have a function that will return a random word out of the array.

1. Open index.html in a browser and it should demo the javascript function pulling a random word from a word list aka dictionary.

2. Get a word list, I am including one from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words aka words_alpha.txt

3. Run the `python writejsArrayFromDict.py > dictionary.js`  to create an new dictionary.js file
